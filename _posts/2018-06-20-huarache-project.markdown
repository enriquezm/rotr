## The Idea

The Huarache Project was just a little experiment I wanted to try out. The basic idea was to:

1. Build my own sandals.
2. Run in them.
3. See the results.

## Why?

It all started at a trail race I was in. I saw this guy show up with sandals and he ended up beating everyone with ease. I was blown away. I mean, I've seen people wearing sandals, but I've never seen them run in them. In a race. On technical terrain. So this sparked up a flame of curiosity which caused me to look into it more.

## Some History

After reading a lot about running in sandals, I came across an indigenous group of people called the Tarahumara. After going through countless articles and videos, I learned that they were/are known for their long-distance running ability. And this was all done barefoot or in their handmade huaraches.

## The Experience

Alright, back to the project. I figured if I wanted to get the experience I was looking for, I would have to go all in and make my sandals from scratch. So that's what I did. With 2 pieces of tire rubber and some extra climbing cord I had, I made a pair of sandals.

I was pretty excited about these sandals. So excited, that I decided I'd go for a run in them. Little did I know, this was a no no. Going from a 12mm drop shoe to a zero-drop, zero-cushion shoe was asking for it. After about half a mile into my run, my calves and basically my whole leg cramped up. My muscles literally locked up and felt so tight. And I ended up being sore for about a week and half after. I was also have a friction issue every time my foot planted on the floor.

After some more thought, I made version 2 of my running sandals.

I added 2 upgrades:

1. Leather sole
2. Stronger cord

This actually worked out pretty well. I ran about 15 miles in these with no major issues. After my body started to catch up with all the sandal running, I started to feel stronger and more efficient with my running.

What came to my surprise were the pains in my knees and right ankle started to go away. I realized, running in these flat sandals required my body to use so many more muscles. Muscles that haven't been used in years. It naturally forced your body to have more of a mid-foot strike instead of a heavy heel strike.
