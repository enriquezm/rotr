## The Idea

- Build my own sandals.
- Run in them.
- See the results.

## The Reason

- Runner I saw took 1st while running in sandals.
- Inspired to try it myself.

## Some History

- The [Tarahumara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar%C3%A1muri) have been running in sandals for years.
- They are known for their long-distance running ability.
- Running is their main source of transportation.

## My Experience

- Tried making my own pair of running sandals.
- They were out of tire rubber and climbing cord.

- Went for a run right off the bat with new sandals.
- Wrecked my body.
- After just a 1/2 mile run, I was sore for 1 week.

After some more thought, I made version 2 of my running sandals.
- Upgraded with leather sole (to reduce some friction)
- Upgrade with softer cord

This actually worked out pretty well. I ran about 15 miles in these with no major issues. After my body started to catch up with all the sandal running, I started to feel stronger and more efficient with my running.

What came to my surprise were the pains in my knees and right ankle started to go away. I realized, running in these flat sandals required my body to use so many more muscles. Muscles that haven't been used in years. It naturally forced your body to have more of a mid-foot strike instead of a heavy heel strike.
