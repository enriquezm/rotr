## The Idea

- Run 4 miles
- Every 4 hours
- For 48 straight hours ... and doing so without crying.

## The Reason

- Build up mental toughness
- Get used to being uncomfortable
- Training for ultra running

## The Plan

- Meet up with friend (also will try this challenge out)
- Set up camp by trail
- Run trail like a mad man
- Document EVERYTHING

## The Proof

I'm going to be recording this all on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32024171) and eventually post it on this post.
