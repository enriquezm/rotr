## The Idea

Run 4 miles, every 4 hours, for 48 straight hours ... and doing so without crying.

## Why?

My main goal in my running is to run as far as I can for as long as I can. I figured the only way to do so would be by conditioning the mind and getting used to being comfortable with uncomfortable.

## The Plan

The plan is to meet up with my buddy and have him pace me throughout the challenge. We're mostly likely going to camp out near the trail. At the camp I'll be eating and sleeping (as much as I can).

## The Proof

I'm going to be recording this all on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32024171) and eventually post it on this post.
