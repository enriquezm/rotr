## The Challenge

- Run 5 miles
- Every 4 hours
- For 24 straight hours
- For a grand total of 40 miles

## The Reason

- Build up mental toughness
- Get used to being uncomfortable
- Training for ultra running

## The Plan

- Meet up with friend (also will try this challenge out)
- Set up camp by trail
- Run trail like a mad man
- Document EVERYTHING

## My Thoughts (Before)

To be honest, I'm not too sure what to expect. It is my first self-assisted challenge so it should be pretty interesting. 

## The Proof

I'm going to be recording this all on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/32024171) and eventually post it on this post. Stay tuned!
