## What was Moonlight Madness?
- trail run race
- 1/2 marathon
- under the full moon!

## My first thoughts on the race
- It was unique.
- It was a mini journey.
- I loved that the moon lit up your path (no headlamp needed).

## What I learned
- Not ready for an ultra race.
- You need to enjoy and appreciate the struggle.
- Gummy bears are my favorite running snack.

# Final thoughts on race
- Recommend it.
- Can't wait to run it again next year.
- Joshua Trees at night, look like people.
